## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

These tools are powerful instruments. Their usage should only be performed on networks and systems where you have **explicit** and written **permission** to conduct testing. Unauthorized use may violate the law.

### **Licensing**

Most of the tools listed above are **Open Source** (free to use and modify), but always check the specific licensing for each tool.

***

**Special Note for Netcat:** Netcat is a fundamental, older tool often included as part of the operating system (like Linux/Unix). Its official source link is often a repository or manual page, hence the general documentation note.
